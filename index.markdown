<br />

AXTU is a system updater used for a linux distribution named Asianux.

I worked in Asianux as AXTU developer, and for a few month as the chief
maintainer. AXTU is a Linux system updater, based on RPM, it has similiar work
flow as YUM, but implemented in C++, it was created by Hansoft engineers, long
time before I joined the development. What I added was:

    * epoch handling
    * obsolete tag handling
